# Welcome to Flamego contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our projects!

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon <img src="https://github.com/github/docs/raw/50561895328b8f369694973252127b7d93899d83/assets/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](/README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

In addition to the general guides with open source contributions, you would also need to:

- Have basic knowledge about HTTP, web applications development and programming in [Go](https://go.dev/).
- Have a working local development setup with a reasonable good IDE or editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go), [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) or [Vim](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go).

## Issues

### Create a new issue

- For questions, ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/flamego/flamego/discussions).
- Check to make sure someone hasn't already opened a similar [issue](https://github.com/flamego/flamego/issues).
- [Choose an issue form](https://github.com/flamego/flamego/issues/new/choose) and follow the guide within the each form.

## Pull requests

TODO:
- Feel free to ask more details or clarification questions!

- Best practices
- Contributing to another codebase is not as simple as code changes, it is also about contributing influence to the design.

Once your proposal and implementation for new middleware are both accpeted and merged, you are eligible to ask for joining the `@flamego/community` team as part of the Flamego organization!
